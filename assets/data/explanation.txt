bitmapWidth >= filterWidth 
- if a bitmap larger than is needed for the filter already exists,
  it will be used rather than creating a new one
- if a bitmap does not exist or is too small, a new one will be created using
  the size of the filter
Regardless the UVs of the bitmap will be set to filterWidth, filterHeight

filterWidth, filterHeight come from __getFilterBounds
-> comes from __getBounds + all filter extensions
-> comes from __graphics.__getBounds
-> class variable Graphics.__bounds
where does Graphics.__bounds get set/modified?
clear() sets __bounds to null
copyFrom() copies the __bounds from the source
__inflateBounds(x,y) will create new bounds at (x,y) if they do not exist,
and otherwise will expand the bounds to encompass (x,y)
